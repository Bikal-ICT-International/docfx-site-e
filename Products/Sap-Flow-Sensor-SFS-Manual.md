# Product Overview

## Introduction

The SFS Sap Flow Sensor precisely measures plant water use using Heat
Ratio Method (HRM). Providing calculated sap velocities, the sensor can
also provide raw needle temperature for post-processing.

Delivering six key metrics via SDI-12 v1.4, including sap flow rates and
velocities, with low power consumption, and a rugged multi-probe design,
it’s built for long-term field use in agriculture, forestry, and
ecology.

Table 4: Program Support

## Getting started

- Connect the sap‑flow sensor to any SDI‑12 v1.4‑compatible data logger
  using the wiring in Figure 2.

- Send the address query *?!* to confirm the sensor is responding.

- Then request its identification string *aI!* to verify the sensor’s
  model and serial number.

Once communication is confirmed, you can prepare the required SDI‑12
program or script before installing the system in the field.

For guidance on writing logger programs and integrating the sensor with
different platforms, please refer to the following documents:

| **Documentation**         | **Description**                                                                                          |

Table 5: Test Example

ICT International recommends bench testing the unit before installation.

### Sensor Test

Place the probes in the optional test block to keep them steady. After
the logger powers the sensor, open the logger’s terminal so you can send
SDI‑12 commands. Run a manual measurement, wait for the sensor to signal
that the reading is ready, and then retrieve the values. If the numbers
look correctly formatted, stable, and sensible, the sensor is wired
properly and ready for installation.

## Example 1: Concurrent Measurement

When using multiple SFS sensors on a logger’s SDI‑12 port, start by
connecting each sensor one at a time and assigning it a unique address
(by default each SFS will have addresses set to “0”). Set up the program
in the logger so it sends the *aC!* command to each sensor in sequence.
Include a 156‑second delay to allow all measurements to finish. After
that, poll each sensor using the *aD0!*, *aD1!*, and *aD2!* commands.
Once the data is returned, save it to the logger’s internal memory or an
external memory card.

<img src="../images/image310326022.png"
style="width:4.63928in;height:3.08823in" />

Figure 4: Concurrent Example

<img src="../images/image310326023.jpeg"
style="width:6.26458in;height:3in" />

Figure 5: HRM Measurement Cycle

Note, a Concurrent HRM command variant (e.g. aC!) will abort if it
exceeds 156 seconds. Hence the supercapacitors must be fully charged
before initiating the command. A Standard HRM command variant (e.g. aM!)
is 383 seconds to ensure that even a fully depleted supercapacitor bank
will charge before a measurement, and the measurement will complete.

## Example 2: Standard Measurement

When using multiple SFS sensors on a single SDI‑12 port, begin by
connecting each sensor individually and assigning it a unique address,
since all SFS units are shipped with the default address 0. After
addressing, the logger must trigger each sensor one at a time using the
standard *aM!* measurement command. SDI‑12 does not allow multiple
sensors to run M! measurements concurrently on the same bus, so each
sensor must complete its full measurement cycle before the next one is
started.

An SFS requires up to 383 seconds to complete a measurement command,
including the time needed to recharge its supercapacitor bank. Because
each sensor must finish before the next can begin, the total measurement
time increases with every additional sensor. For example, six sensors
would require more than 38 minutes to complete a full sequence, which
makes this approach unsuitable for applications with tight timing
requirements or frequent sampling intervals.

After each sensor completes its measurement, the logger can retrieve the
results using *aD0!*, *aD1!*, and *aD2!*, and then store the returned
values in internal or external memory.

<img src="../images/image310326001.png"
style="width:3.48681in;height:2.69375in" />

Figure 6: Sensor Logger Setup (for aM! command)

Note: Use the Measurement command when your sensor logger setup includes
two or more SDI‑12 ports, with each SFS connected to a separate SDI-12
ports. This command is especially helpful when:

• The logger cannot add delays between measurements, and

• The logger’s power is only active during measurement.

In these situations, the Measurement command ensures that every SFS on
each SDI‑12 port can take a reading and properly charge its
supercapacitor bank.

## Example 3: High Volume Measurement

The *0HA!* command is used to request a High‑Volume ASCII measurement
from the sensor at address 0. When this command is sent, the sensor
replies with a message such as 0143480, which indicates three key pieces
of information: the sensor’s address (0), the time remaining before the
full dataset is ready (143 seconds), and the total number of data points
that will be returned (480 values). These 480 values represent
temperature readings collected once per second across four thermistor
channels. The data are arranged in repeating groups of four, where each
second of logging produces values for Thermistor 1 OUT, Thermistor 1 IN,
Thermistor 2 OUT, and Thermistor 2 IN in that order. The index of each
value corresponds to the number of seconds that have passed since the
heat pulse. The full 143‑second measurement period reflects the complete
MHRM sequence, which includes 10 seconds of ADC initialisation, a
3‑second heat pulse, and 130 seconds of heat‑pulse logging and
processing. Once this sequence is complete, the full set of thermistor
data is ready for retrieval.

<img src="../images/image310326002.jpeg"
style="width:6.25972in;height:3in" />Figure 7: Raw Data

Note, a High-Volume raw data (aHA!) command will abort if it exceeds 143
seconds. Hence the supercapacitors must be fully charged before
initiating the command.

### 1.5 Interchangeable Heater and Thermistor Probes

The heater and thermistor probes are designed to be removable so the
sensor can be used on different plant species. The probes may be swapped
while the sensor is powered off, and no software changes are required.
An internal hardware circuit automatically provides the correct heating
energy for the installed heater needle, and the firmware identifies
which heater is connected. In Heat Ratio Method (HRM) measurements, the
heater needle code is returned as the 7th value, and the thermistor
needle diagnostic is returned as the 8th value. For faster checks, the
heater can be identified using the Trigger Heat Pulse command, and the
thermistor can be checked using the Raw Thermistor Data command.

## Appendix A

### SFS Measurement Procedure: Standard HRM

<span id="_Toc225260547"
class="anchor"></span><img src="../images/image310326023.jpeg"
style="width:6.26458in;height:3in" />Figure 18: Standard HRM Measurement

Note, a Concurrent HRM command variant (e.g. aC!) will abort if it
exceeds 156 seconds. Hence the supercapacitors must be fully charged
before initiating the command. A Standard HRM command variant (e.g. aM!)
is 383 seconds to ensure that even a fully depleted supercapacitor bank
will charge before a measurement, and the measurement will complete.

### SFS Measurement Procedure: Raw Data 

<span id="_Toc225260548"
class="anchor"></span><img src="../images/image310326002.jpeg"
style="width:6.25972in;height:3in" />Figure 19: Raw Data

Note, a High Volume raw data (aHA!) command will abort if it exceeds 143
seconds. Hence the supercapacitors must be fully charged before

|                          | During a HRM measurement ('C', 'M' or 'HA'), just after a baseline measurement and before a heat pulse there is a "top up" charge that will last until the supercapacitors have adequate charge for a heat pulse. Note, with a standard interval of 15 minutes between concurrent commands, this will be ~3 seconds. If the interval since the last concurrent command is larger, the bus has only just been powered or if the bus is not powered between measurements, this "top up" charge will be longer and as such, concurrent commands should not be used without script management of power. For simplicity, 'M' commands can be used to ensure that the bus is powered for an adequate time to charge the supercapacitors. |

Layout

This diagram shows where each cable connects on the Sap Flow Sensor
(SFS). The Data port on the left sends measurements out to the logger,
while the three ports on the right are inputs from the probe: Heater
(middle connector) powers the constant current heater, and Upstream and
Downstream (top and bottom connectors) connect to the two thermistor
probes inserted above and below the heater.

### 1.6 Supercapacitor Bank

The supercapacitor bank is used to store energy for heat pulses. The
supercapacitors allow up to 6x SFS devices to be supported on the SDI-12
bus without special power considerations i.e. no need for complicated
software management of power or breaking of protocol power standards.
The supercapacitors nominally charge to 4.8V. They can be diagnosed with
a Supercapacitor Voltage command.

### 1.7 Traditional Sap Flow Meters (SFM1 and SFM1x)

> In traditional SFM and early SFM1x sensors, the heater always receives
> a fixed 12 V supply. Because voltage is constant, the current depends
> entirely on the heater’s resistance (Ohm’s Law).

- Standard heater (18 Ω): 0.67 A

- Corn heater (8 Ω): 1.5 A

- Vine heater (13 Ω): 0.92 A

> This means the corn heater draws 2.2 times, and the vine heater 1.4
> times, the current of the standard heater.
>
> Since Power = Voltage × Current, smaller‑resistance heaters generate
> much more heat per millimetre of needle length:

- Standard: 0.23 W/mm

- Corn: 1.50 W/mm

- Vine: 0.49 W/mm

> As needle size decreases, power per millimetre increases sharply,
> which can overheat and damage plant tissue. Hence, only standard 35mm
> heater is suitable for those instruments.

### 1.8 Constant Current Circuit Advantage

> In the updated design for SFS, all heater types are driven with a
> constant current of 0.67 A. The voltage automatically adjusts based on
> heater resistance:

- Standard (18 Ω): 12.06 V

- Corn (8 Ω): 5.36 V

- Vine (13 Ω): 8.71 V

> This results in much more consistent power per millimetre across all
> heater types:

- Standard: 0.231 W/mm

- Corn: 0.299 W/mm

- Vine: 0.259 W/mm

> Because all heaters share the same needle body, heat is also
> dissipated through the plastic housing, making the actual power/mm
> even more uniform.
