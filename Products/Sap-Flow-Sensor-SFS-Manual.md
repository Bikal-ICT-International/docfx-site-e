# Product Overview

## Introduction

The SFS Sap Flow Sensor precisely measures plant water use using Heat
Ratio Method (HRM). Providing calculated sap velocities, the sensor can
also provide raw needle temperature for post-processing.

Delivering six key metrics via SDI-12 v1.4, including sap flow rates and
velocities, with low power consumption, and a rugged multi-probe design,
it’s built for long-term field use in agriculture, forestry, and
ecology.

## Getting started

- Connect the sap‑flow sensor to any SDI‑12 v1.4‑compatible data logger
  using the wiring in Figure 2.

- Send the address query *?!* to confirm the sensor is responding.

- Then request its identification string *aI!* to verify the sensor’s
  model and serial number.

Once communication is confirmed, you can prepare the required SDI‑12
program or script before installing the system in the field.

For guidance on writing logger programs and integrating the sensor with
different platforms, please refer to the following documents:

*ICT International recommends bench testing the unit before installation.*

### Sensor Test

Place the probes in the optional test block to keep them steady. After
the logger powers the sensor, open the logger’s terminal so you can send
SDI‑12 commands. Run a manual measurement, wait for the sensor to signal
that the reading is ready, and then retrieve the values. If the numbers
look correctly formatted, stable, and sensible, the sensor is wired
properly and ready for installation.

# Sensor configuration options

The SFS is a versatile unit that can be used with other SDI-12 sensors
or in conjunction with other SFS (or a hybrid of these).

By default, the SFS is shipped with the address as 0, therefore it may
be necessary to change the address configuration. When using multiple
SFS sensors on a logger’s SDI‑12 port, start by connecting each sensor
one at a time and assigning it a unique address (by default each SFS
will have addresses set to “0”). This may be necessary with other
sensors that are connected to the data logger as well to avoid clashes.

## Using multiple sensors to measure the Soil, Plant and Atmosphere Continuum: Multi‑Sensor Measurement Timing

style="width:5.79348in;height:4.80099in" />

<span id="_Toc225954454" class="anchor"></span>Figure 4: Multi-sensor
setup

***<u>Measurement Timing and Sensor Coordination</u>***

When multiple SDI‑12 sensors share the same measurement cycle, it is
important that their measurement windows are aligned so the resulting
dataset represents a single, coherent point in time. In this system, the
SFS sap flow sensor has the longest measurement duration, while the
ATH‑VPD and SQ421‑SS complete their measurements within only a few
seconds. For this reason, the SFS must always be triggered first.

1.  *SFS Measurement (Address 0)*

The SFS begins its measurement at the start of the cycle. A full SFS
measurement requires approximately 156 seconds to complete. During this
period, the sensor performs ADC initialization, heating, and internal
processing. No other sensors should be triggered until the SFS
measurement window has finished.

2.  *ATH‑VPD Measurement (Address 1)*

Once the SFS measurement has completed, the ATH‑VPD sensor can be
triggered. This sensor requires only a few seconds to return valid data.
Its measurement window should be scheduled immediately after the SFS
window so that its data represent the same environmental conditions at
the end of the SFS cycle.

3.  *SQ421‑SS Measurement (Address 2)*

The SQ421‑SS PAR sensor also completes its measurement within a few
seconds. It should be triggered directly after the ATH‑VPD, ensuring
that all fast‑responding sensors capture conditions at nearly the same
moment.

*Example Timing Sequence:*

If a measurement cycle begins at 10:00:00 a.m.:

- SFS completes its measurement at approximately 10:02:36 a.m.

- ATH‑VPD completes its measurement a few seconds later

- SQ421‑SS completes shortly after the ATH‑VPD

Because the fast sensors are triggered immediately after the SFS
measurement window, all three sensors effectively represent a common
measurement time of approximately 10:03 a.m.

This sequencing ensures that all sensor outputs are aligned to the same
physical moment, providing consistent and synchronised data for
analysis.

## Using multiple SFS sensors

Depending on how the SFS is connected to the datalogger there are
different approaches to the measuring multiple SFS.

- If wired on a single port (e.g. bussed) then it is necessary to use
  the concurrent command

- If each SFS is connected to an individual port, then they can be
  measured using the standard measurement command.

### Concurrent Measurement

Set up the program in the logger so it sends the *aC!* command to each
sensor in sequence. Include a 156‑second delay to allow all measurements
to finish. After that, poll each sensor using the *aD0!*, *aD1!*, and
*aD2!* commands. Once the data is returned, save it to the logger’s
internal memory or an external memory card.

<img src="../images/image010426024.png"
style="width:4.63928in;height:3.08823in" />

<span id="_Toc225954455" class="anchor"></span>Figure 5: Concurrent Example

<span id="_Toc225954456"
class="anchor"></span><img src="../images/image010426001.jpeg" style="width:6.26458in;height:3in" />

Figure 6: HRM Measurement Cycle

Note, a Concurrent HRM command variant (e.g. aC!) will abort if it
exceeds 156 seconds. Hence the supercapacitors must be fully charged
before initiating the command. A Standard HRM command variant (e.g. aM!)
is 383 seconds to ensure that even a fully depleted supercapacitor bank
will charge before a measurement, and the measurement will complete.

### Standard Measurement

Using the standard *aM!* measurement command, the logger will trigger
each sensor one at a time. SDI‑12 does not allow multiple sensors to run
M! measurements concurrently on the same bus, so each sensor must
complete its full measurement cycle before the next one is started.

An SFS requires up to 383 seconds to complete a measurement command,
including the time needed to recharge its supercapacitor bank. Because
each sensor must finish before the next can begin, the total measurement
time increases with every additional sensor. For example, six sensors
would require more than 38 minutes to complete a full sequence, which
makes this approach unsuitable for applications with tight timing
requirements or frequent sampling intervals.

After each sensor completes its measurement, the logger can retrieve the
results using *aD0!*, *aD1!*, and *aD2!*, and then store the returned
values in internal or external memory.

style="width:3.48681in;height:2.69375in" />

<span id="_Toc225954457" class="anchor"></span>Figure 7: Sensor Logger
Setup (for aM! command)

*Note: Use the Measurement command when your sensor logger setup
includes two or more SDI‑12 ports, with each SFS connected to a separate
SDI-12 ports. This command is especially helpful when:*

- *The logger cannot add delays between measurements, and*

- *The logger’s power is only active during measurement.*

*In these situations, the Measurement command ensures that every SFS on
each SDI‑12 port can take a reading and properly charge its
supercapacitor bank.*

## High Volume Measurement for research purposes

The *0HA!* command asks the sensor at address 0 to begin a High‑Volume
ASCII measurement. When the sensor receives this command, it immediately
replies with a short status message—for example: 0143480.

This response contains three pieces of information:

- Sensor address: 0

- Time remaining until the full dataset is ready: 143 seconds

- Total number of data points that will be available: 480 values

These 480 values are temperature readings collected once per second from
four thermistor channels. The data is arranged in repeating groups of
four:

1. Thermistor 1 OUT – every $4n^{th}$ value ($\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$)
2. Thermistor 1 IN – every $(4n + 1)$ value ($\color{green}{\text{green}}$)
3. Thermistor 2 OUT – every $(4n + 2)$ value ($\color{orange}{\text{orange}}$)
4. Thermistor 2 IN – every $(4n + 3)$ value ($\color{pink}{\text{pink}}$)

<span id="_Toc225954442" class="anchor"></span> Table 9: Raw Data Visualization

Each index in the dataset corresponds to the number of seconds that have
passed since the heat pulse began. Once this sequence finishes, the
complete set of thermistor readings is ready to be retrieved.

Figure 8: Raw Data

Note, a High-Volume raw data (aHA!) command will abort if it exceeds 143
seconds. Hence the supercapacitors must be fully charged before
initiating the command.

# Additional Information

## Interchangeable Heater and Thermistor Probes

The heater and thermistor probes are designed to be removable, allowing
the sensor to be used across different plant species. Probes can be
swapped while the sensor is powered off, and no software adjustments are
required. An internal hardware circuit automatically supplies the
correct heating energy for the installed heater needle, and the firmware
detects which heater is connected. The attached heater needle code is
returned as the 7th value in a Heat Ratio Method (HRM) Measurement
command but can be more efficiently diagnosed with a Trigger Heat Pulse
command (*aC2!*). The attached thermistor needle diagnostics are
similarly returned as the 8th value in a Heat Ratio Method (HRM)
Measurement command but can be more efficiently diagnosed with a Raw
Thermistor Data command (*aC3!*).

The SFS offers three needle lengths:

- 35 mm – *suitable for woody stems*

- 22.5 mm – *suitable for both woody and herbaceous stems*

- 12 mm – *suitable for herbaceous stems with diameters up to 10 mm*

These probes, along with their corresponding heaters, are equipped with
M8 connectors.

*Note: ICT International offers three standard needle sets. Customers
can request custom thermistor positions by printing the HRM Needle
Design.pdf and aligning it with the desired sapwood profile.*

## Supercapacitor Bank

The supercapacitor bank is used to store energy for heat pulses. The
supercapacitors allow up to 6x SFS devices to be supported on the SDI-12
bus without special power considerations i.e. no need for complicated
software management of power or breaking of protocol power standards.
The supercapacitors nominally charge to 4.8V. They can be diagnosed with
a Supercapacitor Voltage command.

## Heater Power Management

A key component of a reliable sap flow sensor is a circuitry that
maintains stable and predetermined current flowing through the heater
needle. In the SFS, all heater types are driven with a constant current
of 0.67 A. The voltage automatically adjusts based on heater resistance:

- 35 mm (18 Ω): 12.06 V

- 12 mm (8 Ω): 5.36 V

- 22.5 mm (13 Ω): 8.71 V

This results in much more consistent power per millimeter across all
heater types which is roughly 0.263 W/mm.

while the three ports on the right are inputs from the probe: Heater
(middle connector) powers the constant current heater, and Upstream and
Downstream (top and bottom connectors) connect to the two thermistor
probes inserted above and below the heater.
